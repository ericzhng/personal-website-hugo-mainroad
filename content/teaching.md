I have been GSI-ing the course twice, working with the same instructor (Dr. Aaron Johnson), during fall 2017 and fall 2018 semesters. 

## Main duties

 * Proposed and organized a series of 15-minute pre-class research talks which stimulated studentsâ€™ strong interest in structural areas.
 * Assisted instructor in preparing the undergraduate course (AE215: structural mechanics), including preparing homework, exams questions and solutions.
 * Held review classes and office hours to assist students in homework and exams.
