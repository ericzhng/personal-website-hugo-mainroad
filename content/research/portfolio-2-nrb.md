Non-reflective boundary techniques are typically used in simulation to reduce boundary reflections and reduce model size. The non-reflective boundary conditions and boundary layer methods are developed and implemented in UM-LISA to faciliate simulation so that users can focus on the area of interest while avoiding boundary interferences.

The current implementation of NRB techniques implemented in UM-LISA are illustrated below

The following picture shows the performance of different NRB techniques.
