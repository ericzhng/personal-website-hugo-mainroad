Guided Wave is one of the most promising tools for damage detection in the field of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), because it can travel long distance without much decay, and is highly sensitive to micro-damage due to its short wavelength. But guided wave is highly dispersive and has infinite number of modes, and is further complicated by the interactions with transducers, boundaries and damage, which renders the modeling of guided wave a rather difficult task.
