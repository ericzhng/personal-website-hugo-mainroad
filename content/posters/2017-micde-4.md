This work introduces a fast, versatile and reliable guided wave simulation tool, University of Michigan/Local Interaction Simulation Approach (UM/LISA), for modeling both linear and nonlinear guided wave interactions with boundaries, piezoelectric transducers and different damage types. This tool provides a much more efficient alternative to Finite Element (FE) software, and serves as a design tool for damage detection system design and elastic waves related structural design. The underlying algorithm of UM/LISA is introduced first. Some major developments, including contact penalty method, non-reflective boundary and multiple-GPU implementation are demonstrated then. Finally, ongoing work for modelling elastic metamaterial structures using UM/LISA and their applications are shown.
